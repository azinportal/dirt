h1. Dirt Readme

Dirt is a reporting frontend to Best Practical ["Request Tracker":http://bestpractical.com/rt/]. It was written to facilitate my work at ["Directi":http://www.directi.com], who kindly let me work on it during regular working hours.

h3. Features

* An arbitrary number of dashboards
* A wiki for documentation
* Tabular reports 
* Prettier than RT (IMO)
* ... more to come (see ["TODO list below":"#todo-list")

h3. Installation

Installation is still pretty clunky:	

* Clone the source
* Install Ruby 1.9.3 if you don't already have it. Using ["rvm":https://rvm.io] for this is highly recommended.
* Run @bundle install@ to fetch dependencies. Using rvm's gemsets feature to isolate these dependencies is a good idea.
* Copy @config/database.yml.sample@ to @config/database.yml@ and edit. Note that there are *two* database configurations:
** @rt@ : Your existing Request Tracker database. With the current featureset this can be read-only access. This will change with later releases.
** @dirt@ : A new empty database that you have created for dirt.
* Run @rake db:migrate@ to create the dirt schema.
* Run @cd db; ruby create_views.rb < mapping.json > create-views.sql@
* Review @create-views.sql@ -- TL;DR It create a few views so we have a schema that is ORM friendly and to make report queries more intuitive. 
* Run @create-views.sql@ against your RT database. Consult your RDBMS documentation to find out how to do this. *Note:* @create-views.sql@ uses MySQL's dialect of SQL.
* Run: @RACK_ENV=<env> ruby application.rb@. Ruby rack integration is currently broken.

h4. Really clunky bits

* Add entries into in the projects table in the dirt db. See the default value of @tab_spec@ to configure the tabs of your project.

h3. Using Dirt

* Navigate to http://your.host.name/projects/yourproject/pages
* Use ["textile":http://redcloth.org/textile] syntax to add text content to the page.
* Add a query using the following syntax:

<pre>
<~
{
  "type": "table",
  "sql":"SELECT COUNT(id) AS Count, Owner AS Name FROM expanded_tickets WHERE Queue = 'linux-hosting' AND Status IN('new', 'open', 'stalled') GROUP BY Owner",
  "caption": "Ticket Ownership"
}
~>
</pre>

p. Any arbitrary SQL statement querying the 'expanded_tickets' view can be used to report on tickets.
